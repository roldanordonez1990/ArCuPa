          <p>Frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not...interlock. My Uncle Rory was the stodgiest taxidermist you've ever met by day. But I haven't spent any money! I was all... dead and frugal. The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. Should I start this program over? It's a real burn, being right so often. Can't call to mom, can't say a word. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me. If I could make you purtier, I would.</p> </div>

          <p>Everybody started singing and dancing. I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats. They need to take seven and they might take yours. Any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt. Who's calling me? Everybody I know lives here. Can't even shout, can't even cry. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. I wanna hurt you, but I can't resist the sinister attraction of your cold and muscular body! In their resting state, our actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children.</p>
